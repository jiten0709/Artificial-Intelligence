# Artificial Intelligence Project

A comprehensive collection of Artificial Intelligence concepts, algorithms, and implementations. This repository explores fundamental and advanced AI techniques, with a focus on building practical, real-world applications.

## üöÄ About The Project

This repository serves as a practical guide and codebase for understanding and implementing various AI patterns, particularly in the domain of autonomous AI agents and complex workflows. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented, and functional examples that demonstrate how to build sophisticated AI systems.

## üìÇ What's Inside

This repository is structured to cover key patterns in building modern AI applications. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

### ü§ñ AI Agents

This is the core section, focusing on the design and implementation of autonomous AI agents.

#### 1. Agentic Design Patterns

Fundamental building blocks for creating intelligent and capable agents.

- **Reasoning Engine:** Implementing the core logic and decision-making capabilities of an agent.
- **Planning:** Exploring techniques that allow agents to create and execute multi-step plans to achieve complex goals.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Demonstrating how multiple specialized agents can communicate and collaborate to solve problems more effectively.
- **Tool Use:** Enabling agents to interact with and utilize external tools, APIs, and data sources to extend their capabilities.

#### 2. Agentic Workflows

Patterns for orchestrating complex, multi-step tasks using one or more AI agents.

- **Reflection:** A pattern where an agent can review its own output, identify flaws, and iteratively improve its work.
- **Parallelization:** Techniques for running multiple agent tasks concurrently to improve speed and efficiency.
- **Orchestrator-Worker:** A powerful pattern where a central "orchestrator" agent breaks down a complex task and delegates sub-tasks to specialized "worker" agents.
- **Evaluator-Optimizer:** A self-correcting workflow where one agent evaluates the output of another, providing feedback that is used by an "optimizer" agent to refine the result.
